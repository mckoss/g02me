#summary About Us landing page from g02.me

G02.ME was started as a Google Hack-a-Thon project in Seattle in August, 2008 by Mike Koss.

This is my second !AppEngine project, but the first to be released (the other one being a !JavaScript application platform, [http://pageforest.com PageForest]).

G02.ME combines the functionality of a URL-shortening service, with other social bookmarking features that have interested me (social ranking, community commenting, and feedback).  I was also interested in experimenting with very light-weight interfaces, and particular "command-line" style text interfaces for attributing comments to users, and adding tags.

I have been developing software since 1983, at Microsoft (Excel, Outlook, !SharePoint).  In 2002 I left Microsoft to join the startup community in Seattle, working at Faves.com, and starting the software development co-working space, [http://startpad.org StartPad].
