G02.ME was started as a Google Hack-a-Thon project in Seattle in August, 2008 by Mike Koss.

This is my second AppEngine project, but the first to be released (the other one being a JavaScript application platform, [PageForest](http://pageforest.com)).

G02.ME combines the functionality of a URL-shortening service, with other social bookmarking features that have interested me (social ranking, community commenting, and feedback).  I was also interested in experimenting with very light-weight interfaces, and particular "command-line" style text interfaces for attributing comments to users, and adding tags.

I have been developing software since 1983, at Microsoft (Excel, Outlook, SharePoint).  In 2002 I left Microsoft to join the startup community in Seattle, working at Faves.com, and starting the software development co-working space, [StartPad](http://startpad.org).
