Go2.me Video Tour Script (4 minutes)

(START SIGNED OUT)

THIS IS A VIDEO TOUR OF Go2.me - a Link Shortening service WITH SOME ADDED FEATURES.

GO TO ME can take a long URL and turn it into a shorter one, which you can then send to your friends
in email, IM, or twitter messages.  Let me show you how it works, and then I'll show you some MORE
advanced features.

First, I'll visit the Go2.me site (G OH 2.ME).  Here you'll find a special link called a bookmarklet.
You can drag this directly into your browsers toolbar.  THIS WILL ADD A BUTTON TO YOUR BROWSER THAT YOU
CAN USE TO SHORTEN A LINK NO MATTER WHAT WEB SITE YOU'RE VISITING.  IF YOU'RE USING INTERNET EXPLORER,
FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS ON THE HOME PAGE TO ADD THE BOOKMARKLET.

NOW LETS VISIT A WEB PAGE WE WANT TO SHARE WITH SOME FRIENDS.  I'LL GO TO THIS ONE.

http://mckoss.com/crypto/enigma.html

THIS ISN'T A VERY LONG LINK, BUT IT WILL STILL TAKE QUITE A BIT OF ROOM IN MY MESSAGE WHEN I WANT TO
TWITTER ABOUT IT.

JUST CLICK THE GO TO ME BOOKMARKLET AND THE LONG URL IS REPLACED BY A MUCH SHORTER ONE.  IN FACT, GO TO
ME LINKS ARE ONLY 16 CHARACTERS LONG.

NOW JUST COPY THE NEW LINK ADDRESS AND PASTE IT INTO TWITTER.

"Check out this Paper Enigma Machine - http://go2.me/8"

WHEN YOU FRIENDS GET YOUR MESSAGE AND CLICK ON THE LINK, THEY WILL NOT ONLY SEE THE WEB PAGE YOU SHARED
WITH THEM, BUT THEY CAN ALSO COMMENT ON THE PAGE IN THE GO TO ME HEADER.  THATS BECAUSE GO TO ME WRAPS
EVERY WEB PAGE IN THIS INFORMATION HEADER.

"This is cool!"

THE HEADER TELLS YOU WHEN THE LINK WAS FIRST SHARED, HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE VIEWED IT, AND SHOWS ALL THE
COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE.

NOW LET ME SHOW YOU SOME ADVANCED FEATURES.

IF YOU WANT TO HAVE GO TO ME KEEP TRACK OF ALL THE LINKS YOU'VE SHARED, JUST CHOOSE A NICKNAME WHEN YOU
ADD A COMMENT.

(demo: This is a new comment)

WHEN I CLICK ON MY NICKNAME, I CAN SEE ALL MY MOST RECENT ACTIVITY ON THE GO TO ME SITE.

(click back to link)

YOU CAN ALSO TAG A LINK WITH KEYWORDS, PLACED RIGHT INSIDE THE COMMENT.  JUST LIST THEM INSIDE OF SQUARE
BRACKETS AT THE END OF YOUR COMMENT.

(go2me, seattle)

NOTICE THAT GO2.ME REMEMBERS BY NICKNAME FOR ALL MY FUTURE COMMENTS SO I DON'T HAVE TO TYPE IT AGAIN.

NOTE YOU CAN CLICK ON A TAG AND SEE ALL THE MOST POPULAR LINKS THAT USE THAT TAG.

EACH DAY, GO TO ME KEEPS TRACK OF HOW MANY TIMES PEOPLE ARE SHARING, VIEWING AND COMMENTING ON LINKS -
SO YOU CAN SEE WHAT IS MOST POPULAR BY VISITING ONE OF THESE TAG PAGES, OR GOING TO THE GO TO ME HOME
PAGE.

(home page)

IF YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT NO ONE ELSE USES THE NICKNAME YOU'VE CHOSEN, YOU CAN CREATE AN ACCOUNT
USING YOUR GOOGLE ACCOUNT - JUST CLICK CREATE ACCOUNT FROM THE HOME PAGE.

THERE IS MORE INFORMATION ABOUT GO TO ME, INCLUDING A PAGE WHERE YOU CAN SEND ME FEEDBACK AND
INFORMATION FOR SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS TO BE ABLE TO USE GO TO ME IN THEIR OWN PROGRAMS.

THANKS FOR WATCHING - I HOPE YOU ENJOY USING GO TO ME!
