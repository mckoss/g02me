  X User comments
  - Design (see delicious page: http://delicious.com/url/6e4e9fc8547418f22ac89a5f7558e58b?show=notes_only, for inspiration)
- Home
  - Number of pages
  - Number of views
  - Number of people (unique IP?)
  X IE instructions for creating bookmark
  X Recently popular pages
  - JSON api for most popular
  - Tag cloud
- Info Header
	- Info bar horizontal/vertical option
	- Pull web page image from Sphere or Alexa?
	X Move comment bar to top - comments rev-chron below

- User Settings
  - Profile image
  - Enable anonymous creation of new comments (for "shared" user accounts)
  - Friend feed and twitter account info

X Design and styling
X favicon
X favicon cached?  Can't see new one!
- Sharing options
  - Twitter
  - Friendfeed
  - Faves
  - MailTo
X Lock top pane on navigation? -> Don't know how
X JSON API
! JSON documentation - link from home
X domain redirection for http://g02.me (what is pageforest doing???)
X URL names not conflict with commands
X base64 encode ids
- In-page JSCRIPT bookmaklet
  - get metadata from page?  (description)
  - get micro-formats from page
- Performance
  - Shard counter(s) - pages, visitors
X Scoring by views, votes, and comments
- Monetization
  - AdSense
  - Sponsored links (AdManager)
  - PayPal donation (or GooglePayments)
X Unicode in title
X special case g02.me urls -> just redirect back to them - don't alias them
X Should child page links remove the upper frame (can I track changes?)
X Change date to DateTime
X Error page for non-existant URL - should be home page display with error message (Or custom file not found page! 404)
X 301 redirect www.g02.me to g02.me - use Django middleware?
- Get truncate templatetags working - I think I need an installed application - restructure files to
  an app folder, add to INSTALLED_APPS?
X Restructure files to Django standards - application dir, models.py, views.py...
! Figure out if there is a work-around for NYT pages that don't like to be shown inside a frameset.
- A/B Testing on home page and header?  Google Website optimizer
X Get trailing slash off of urls!
- Widget showing number of views and shares of the current url - click to share
  - Need JSON call for lookup by url (but don't increase share count)
- Use google safebrowsing api to warn about viewing of unsafe urls
X refactor - Trap all exceptions to universal error page - use django middleware
! delete comments enabled
  - Just hide non-anonymous comments - based on vote threshold
X Username cookie (suggest for comments)
- Per-user cookie to open all URLs in info-mode
X Domain registration - map
X Analytics setup
X Page title customization
X Test deployment
- rss feeds for users, tags, all
- User account
  - Claim a username by signing in
  - Require login to comment using a claimed username
  - Protects your comments from being edited or deleted by others
  - Ability to delete and edit your older comments
  - Ability to delete and edit anonymous comments
  - Ability to mark even claimed comments as "spam/bad"
    - two (independent) votes will hide that comment from all but the author of the comment.
  - Mark URL as Spam - info-mode only AND prominently flagged as SPAM
  - Mark URL as Adult - require login and affirmation of over 18 and OK to view adult content
- Detect or mark problem domains as info-mode pages (frameset unfriendly).
- Should not update view count when comments are added
X Add scroll bar when there are more comments than fit the head frame (or scale frame to fit)
- Use memcache
X Unit tests
X Store key instead of model in timescore - don't have problem of ModelExists needing to be called - punt
X Admin routine to clean up scores for non-existant (delted) models
X don't allow links to g02.me pages
- prune empty commments
- don't recognize http: as a user name
X auto-hyperlink http addresses in comments
  - convert to g02me links automatically?
X comments ordered
- Throttle scoring for a given user, or IP address
  - Drop userid cookie on user
  - Throttling middleware
  - Use memcache to set rates
- Require dev key for jscript calls (registered user)
X About Page
X AppEngine Logo
- Blog
- Don't count views by web crawlers
  - If no userid cookie - don't count it!  (note that Frame will set cookie, and head will then count!)
X Page not found should be a 404 page
X add expires meta http header to fix google cache bug
X URL's with tailing "/" are not normalized to the non-trailing versions leading to duplicates
- Is it possible to implement info/Close box so that currently navigated page is retained?
  - See if window.location.href is accessible from parent frameset
- Fix comment counts
X Cache broken again?
