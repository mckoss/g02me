  X Require login to comment using a claimed username
  X Protects your comments from being edited or deleted by others
  - Just hide non-anonymous comments - based on vote threshold
  - Ability to mark even claimed comments as "spam/bad"
    - two (independent) votes will hide that comment from all but the author of the comment.
  ! Mark URL as Spam - info-mode only AND prominently flagged as SPAM
  ! Mark URL as Adult - require login and affirmation of over 18 and OK to view adult content
  X Profile image
  - Friend feed and twitter account info
- Admin interface to block/throttle IP's, users, domains, referers

    - statistics (write through view counter)
    - comments
  X home page (keep for 60 seconds) - Adjust expires header
  - tag pages (keep until url added to tag - age at 5 minutes)
  X add a template tag that will auto-cache a page section - copy from Django 1.0
X Install profiling to do performance testing and tuning
! /user/x pages are too slow - optimize scoring queries?
X Displaying comment counts in home page query has exceeded quota - CommentCount

------------------------------------------------------------

    - View: 1 point
    - Share: 3 points
    - Comment: 2 points
    - Clustering:

------------------------------------------------------------
                           BUGS
------------------------------------------------------------

X Anon sharing is throwing exception
- Don't score anonymous views!
! Is it possible to implement info/Close box so that currently navigated page is retained?
  - See if window.location.href is accessible from parent frameset
X Disallow 'http' as a username (mistake in posting links)
X Truncate titles with elipses in views
  - django filter
- BUG: Share count should never be zero (even if not scoring)
- Don't __share an item that's been shared by you previously (especially don't add duplicate comment entry)
- Should limit comment scoring to one per user
- Anonymous user is getting shared+1 and viewed+1...
X Timeouts of AJAX calls (claim username) do not generate errors
X Require that domains have a . in them to be valid (no intranet domains) 
X Embedded links in comments need to target _top
X Uneven margins in safari and Chrome.
X Chrome table extends beyond the bounds of the page
- Usernames are case sensitive - shouldn't be
X Can share domains beginning with numbers! - http://www.3rivers.net/~cmac/index.html
- Have to hit signout twice to sign out of account (first times out)
- Losing username saved in cookie?
- When logged in - can't over-ride switch to non-logged in account (e.g., "anon: foo") - unit test failure!
X UnicodeDecodeError

! Resetting iframe is navigating the parent frame???
- Rename "views" to "viewers" and "comments" to "commenters" and "shared" to "sharers".
- Allow static IP n.n.n.n shortening (e.g., Google Cache links).
- Normalize/merge upper/lowercase differences in user names (eg. Calbucci)
