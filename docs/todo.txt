    - two (independent) votes will hide that comment from all but the author of the comment.
  ! Mark URL as Spam - info-mode only AND prominently flagged as SPAM

  - Use GA event tracking instead???
- Setvar user partitioning
  - "user" (as opposed to anon)

  - "premium"
  - OR - assign a composite "engagement" score and cluster 1 week half-life:
    - Username: +10 points
    - View: 1 point
    - Share: 3 points
    - Comment: 2 points
    - Clustering:

	  - (user, username/new-auth, [from-home, from-comment], [ip])
	  - (load-times, home/user/tag, [tag]/[user], [ms])
	  - (url, share/comment/view, [domain])
! Don't track info pages but redirect to frameset when top?

                           BUGS
------------------------------------------------------------

! Anon sharing is throwing exception
- don't recognize http: as a user name
- Don't count anonymous views!
! Is it possible to implement info/Close box so that currently navigated page is retained?
  - See if window.location.href is accessible from parent frameset
- Disallow 'http' as a username (mistake in posting links)
- Truncate titles with elipses in views
  - django filter
- BUG: Share count should never be zero (even if not scoring)
- Don't __share an item that's been shared by you previously (especially don't add duplicate comment entry)
- Should limit comment scoring to one per user
- Anonymous user is getting shared+1 and viewed+1...
- Multiple __share comments per user are possible - shouldn't be
