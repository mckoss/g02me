- Google Gadget
- Use google safebrowsing api to warn about viewing of unsafe urls
- Link safety
	- Per-user setting to open all URLs in info-mode
	- Mark as spam/adult
! RSS feeds:
  - user activity
  - tags
  - home(popular)
  - user "favorites"
  - user+tag
  - use feedburner?
  - make easy to get email update from feedburner (top page, and comments on user page)
- User account
  - Claim a username by signing in
  - Claim your account (provide google, twitter, or Go2.me password)
  - Require login to comment using a claimed username
  - Protects your comments from being edited or deleted by others
  - Just hide non-anonymous comments - based on vote threshold
  - Ability to mark even claimed comments as "spam/bad"
    - two (independent) votes will hide that comment from all but the author of the comment.
  ! Mark URL as Spam - info-mode only AND prominently flagged as SPAM
  ! Mark URL as Adult - require login and affirmation of over 18 and OK to view adult content
  - Profile image
  - Friend feed and twitter account info
- Detect or mark problem domains as info-mode pages (frameset unfriendly).
- don't recognize http: as a user name
- convert embedded comment links to g02me links automatically
- Throttling/Abuse
  - Admin interface to block/throttle IP's, users, domains, referers
- G02.ME email accounts for admin email from address
- Don't count anonymous views!
! Is it possible to implement info/Close box so that currently navigated page is retained?
  - See if window.location.href is accessible from parent frameset
- Use memcache to improve performance of popularity pages
- Link statistics
	- Log referers for a url - display click sources ala YouTube and bit.ly Statistics
	- Log search terms and number of click through via search (info merge first?)
- Full text search (google Search widget or API)
- Error reporting
  - Better tracking of backtrace in log files (even with DEBUG=False)
  - Send email to admin account on unexpected failures
- Auto-tag domains (nyt.com, e.g.)
- Popularity views flags/icons
  ! Up/Down Arrows
  - "New" marker
  - Base on 2x rate on next higher halfLife scale
- Mobile
  - Bookmarklet?
  - Simplified and smaller display (Marcelo)
  - Test on iPhone, Windows Mobile, Blackberry, G1
! Replies page for users - show follow on comments on URL's user's have shared or commented on.
  - Option to show /user/xxx sorted by popularity (not date of last comment) 
  - Need "unfollow" capability to stop getting notified
  - Plan:
    - Use the most recent 100 comments by a user as their "following" list.
    - Annotate Map with username (incl. anon) of most recent commenter (or comment seq #)
    - Highlight all comments where last commenter is NOT yourself (or comment seq # > than user's comment)
  - Create RSS feed - and instructions on getting mail for the feed (feedburner?)
! Feature: New activity indicator in /user/xxx
  - Annotate Map with username (incl. anon) of most recent commenter (or comment seq #)
  - When viewing Info for a Map I've already commented on, update the dateViewed in that comment
  - Highlight comments (yellow background?) that have recent COMMENTS later than my last dateViewed.
- Reduce duplication of URL's
  - www.* vs *
  - upper/lower case differences
  - use initially seen URL as canonical?
! Star the info page (faster than leaving a comment - but puts it in your comment queue)
  - Generate __fave comment
  - Icons in user activity for Shared, Commented, Favorite/Watch/Follow, Wish List
  - Custom RSS feed of favorited links (can all be in one page)
  - Alternativly, "Follow" the infopage?
  - Help users make live bookmarks?
- Add thousands sep for counts in analytics (info, home, tags, user)
  - Add as Django filter
- Paging control for user activity pages
  - Implement as month ranges
  - Indicate in page header that older pages have NOT been updated (no need for crawlers to re-index)
  - Links in home user activity page to named month ranges ("mckoss's activity for October 2008")
  - Build efficient queries for all activity in a month - limit to 50 comments
  - Potential for unreachable comments beyond 50 comments in any one month
- Centralize error messages and codes in one file
! Integrate info page and frameset onto one page (IFRAME)
  - One page for Google to crawl
  - All links count to get info/content
  - No more double counting analytics via /info
  - Resizing/scrolling of info box
- Disallow 'http' as a username (mistake in posting links)
- Import bookmarks/faves
- Document Hungarian for python/jscript doc
- Number of (and List of) "current" users
  - Sliding window of unique user counts (by minute)
  - show users in last 15 minutes as "current" (merge all windows)
  - update calc once each minute - memcache
- Truncate titles with elipses in views
  - django filter
- BUG: Share count should never be zero (even if not scoring)
- Spam - faked title - /3f
- Code Refactoring
	- Make ScoreSet not a Model - just globals
	- break up comments, map, and globals into their own .py files
- Site Administration
	- Log when application is loaded
	- Log when memcache is empty (does it ever empty?)
- Don't __share an item that's been shared by you previously (especially don't add duplicate comment entry)
- Marcelo feedback:
  - One-click install in IE
    - Look for IE Add to Favorites extension - window.external.AddFavorite(url, title)
  - "How to use G02.ME" instead of "Install the Bookmarklet"
    - Call to Action box - stand out (bigger type/box/color/graphics)
  - Declutter the home page by moving "What is G02.me" to another page.
- Enable users to make custom aliases
    - if 6 characters or less prepend '~'
    - slugify
    - display aliases in info panel
    - allow 3 aliases per URL
- Do screencast explaining what you can do with G02.ME
- Multiple __share comments per user are possible - shouldn't be
- Google User Accounts
  - Persistent cookie (30 days) in lieu of Google Auth
- Twitter features
  - User Profile Page - twitter info
  - Anonymous twitter encrypted cookie
  - RSS Feed auto-twitter
  - Claim your account button
  - Allow claiming of account with pseudonomyous twitter user name
  - Can put encryption key to decode twitter password in a cookie - ensures we don't
    store an offline usable twitter password on the server
    - key = H('key', username, password) - not stored on server- saved in cookie
    - passStored = E(key, twitter-password)
    - twitter-password = D(key, passStored)
- Polls
- Pop-up alert to set nickname on anonymous commenting
- Private version on google apps for domains
  - Partition database by domain
- Email notifications of watch list
- Fix styling of head to have smooth clipping of left-hand block

  - Send email notification
- Analytics Pagetracking for goals
  - /meta/username - client
  - /meta/comment - client
  - /meta/share - ??? server/deferred to next page ??? -> do all the same way!
  - /meta/newuser - server
  - SetVar for user state [base, comment, share, username]
  - Any way to use GA for JSON call tracking?
  - Use GA event tracking instead???
- Setvar user partitioning
  - "user" (as opposed to anon)
  - "admin"
  - "premium"
  - OR - assign a composite "engagement" score and cluster 1 week half-life:
    - Username: +10 points
    - View: 1 point
    - Share: 3 points
    - Comment: 2 points
    - Clustering:
      0-5: Low
      6-10: Medium
      11-25: High
      26-100: Very High
      101+: Extremely High
    - Store as compound value- last week's score, this week's score (cluster)
      - e.g. None-Low or VeryHigh-High
  - Use cookies for storage (no server-side session storage)
- Track Progeny of users
  - Associate each user with a "parent" user id - first page view authored by....
- Can I show top views each week for each user's shares?
- Track one week half-life rates for each user (stored in cookies)
    - share
    - comment

- AJAX not working on mobile
  - G1
  - Blackberry
  - iPhone
  - How to install bookmarklet on iPhone, G1, and Blackberry
- For limiting scoring on a single URL
  - Change _FLimit to use a single memcache block with lists of the source authors
    rather than one memchace per user * url combination
! Don't log referer of domains from the bookmarklet use (analytics)
  - When referer equals the url of the link - then it is a bookmarklet use
- Move requser to req.usertrack
  - Only req is stored in local
- Move FinalResponse to context processor 
- Form post method of posting a URL
- Anonymous user is getting shared+1 and viewed+1...
- Should limit comment scoring to one per user
! Event tracking
  - (Category, Action, Label, Value):
	  - (user, username/new-auth, [from-home, from-comment], [ip])
	  - (load-times, home/user/tag, [tag]/[user], [ms])
	  - (url, share/comment/view, [domain])
! Don't track info pages but redirect to frameset when top?
